=begin
Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. The first argument is a
count, and the second is the first number of a sequence that your method will
create. The method should return an Array that contains the same number of
elements as the count argument, while the values of each element will be
multiples of the starting number.

  (1..count).each_with_object([]) {|num, array| array << sequence * num }

sequence(5, 1) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sequence(4, -7) == [-7, -14, -21, -28]
sequence(3, 0) == [0, 0, 0]
sequence(0, 1000000) == []
